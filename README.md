# CodeEval Solutions

This is the code that I've used to solve the challenges on CodeEval.com. When I first posted
this repository, I ranked 26 among 4000+ participants.

I hope these come in handy for someone learning to code. Soon, I'll be launching a new website,
[thinkcode.io](http://thinkcode.io), to help new coders who are aspiring to become professional developers and engineers.

I've posted all my work, even those that are partial solutions or ones that fail. So don't be 
surprised if something doesn't work right.

The solutions are written in Ruby (2.0), JavaScript, C++, and Python (2.7).


## C++ code

To compile the C++ code, I used `clang++` on Mac OS Yosemite.

    clang++ overlapping_rectangles.cc -o overlapping_rectangles
    

## Executing the Code

You can run each submission with the input file provided in the input/ folder with the same name
as the script.

    python advanced_calculator.py input/advanced_calculator.txt

Some of the submissions have a working "test" mode that I used during development. You can enter
test mode by adding the `--test` flag. Some script in test mode don't take an input file.

    python advanced_calculator.py input/advanced_calculator.txt --test


## Todo

1. Problem descriptions and solution explanations
2. Revise C++ code to have same Helpers class.
3. Combine useful code into reusable libraries.
4. Finish CodeEval!


## Collaboration

If you're learning to code, I'm happy to help explain solutions or provide guidance. Reach out
